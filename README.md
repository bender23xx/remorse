# remorse
remorse is a feature rich and multipurpose discord bot. With our server protections, configurations, moderation, utility, and so much more, you can seriously increase your server's activity while also enforcing rules and punishing users that deserve it. We have big things coming up soon so you can compete and climb your business up to the top. If you would like more information on how the bot started or any information regarding the bot in general, please join our support server. The bot is running on a private VPS Vitrual Private Server. So it usually runs 24/7 unless I'm fixing bugs, adding updates (which are always scheduled), or switching to a different server via the VPS. This bot is kid-friendly and is mainly used for communities of the aesthetic tone.
